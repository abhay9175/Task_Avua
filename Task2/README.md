This Terraform code provisions an AWS VPC, subnet, security group, and an EC2 instance to deploy a Go application. The Go application (app.go) is copied to the EC2 instance and then executed using SSH.

Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine.

Create a new Terraform file (e.g., main.tf) and copy the provided code into it.

terraform init
terraform apply
Terraform will create the VPC, subnet, security group, and EC2 instance. It will also copy the app.go file to the EC2 instance and execute the Go application.

Accessing the Go Application:

Once the Terraform apply is complete, the public IP address of the EC2 instance will be shown as an output. You can access the Go application using the provided public IP address and port 8080. The output will display the URL for accessing the Go application.
